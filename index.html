                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I am <strong>Naseeb Ahammed</strong> from the southern part of <strong>India</strong> called Kerala.
                    It has nearly 600 km of Arabian Sea shoreline and India's tropical Malabar Coast.
                    Because of our natural beauty, it is easy to be creative. When I was a kid, my dream used to be a
                    Software Engineer,
                    unfortunately, I couldn't. So I decided to learn Web Designing. <br> <br>

                    In the beginning, I went to an institution to learn Web Design. While learning, I was using the
                    Internet to learn and improve my knowledge in a short period. That was the movement I realized, the
                    syllabus I was learning is the old traditional method.
                    The world is changing and technology is changing day by day, so I decided to self-learn everything
                    from the internet. <br><br>

                    From that day onwards, I am still learning new things on my own, it made me confident. And on my
                    20th birthday, I became a Web Design teacher in an institution. That was a big step in my life.
                    After some time I resigned and became a Freelance Designer. <br> <br>

                <p>My first was a teacher. After completing my course, I have started seeking a web designer job.
                    Unexpectedly, I have got an interview from an institution called G-Tec Computer Education in Kannur,
                    Kerala, India. I was so excited to be a teacher. Because while am teaching, I can learn a new method
                    of designing and gain in-depth knowledge about what I am doing.</p> <br>

                <p>I was teaching the basic Web Design codes like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, JQuery, also some

                    resigned from that job and started Freelance Web designing.
